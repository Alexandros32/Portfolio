# ALEXANDROS CHELIDONIS/CV&PORTFOLIO

This is a website that I created for my CV and Portfolio. My website will be used by future employers to find out more about my skills and experience. My resume presents my work history , skills, and other qualifications. My portfolio gives possible employers a more detailed look at the work that I have done.

## UX

The page is designed to summarise all my academic, professional and personal achievements in order to entice or interest a hiring manager when applying for a new job opportunity. At the end of the page there is a direct possibility to contact me.

### USER STORIES

I used Google Chrome's Development tools to constantly test each change that I made to my website and to ensure that it appeared in the desired way on different screen sizes. I also tested my website on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet and desktop) to ensure it appeared in the desired way on different devices.
I also used https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly to test if it's mobile friendly.
