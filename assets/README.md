# ALEXANDROS CHELIDONIS/CV&PORTFOLIO

This is a website that I created for my CV and Portfolio. My website will be used by future employers to find out more about my skills and experience. My resume presents my work history , skills, and other qualifications. My portfolio gives possible employers a more detailed look at the work that I have done.

## UX

The page is designed to summarise all my academic, professional and personal achievements in order to entice or interest a hiring manager when applying for a new job opportunity. At the end of the page there is a direct possibility to contact me


### USER STORIES

- As a potential employer I might also require a cover letter and a completed application form from you.
- As your professional mentor I would also like to see more projects in your portfolio in the future.
- As a potential employer I want to be able to see  your social media links  in your CV so that I can learn more about you.
